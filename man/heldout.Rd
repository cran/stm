\title{
Heldout Likelihood by Document Completion}
\description{
Tools for making and evaluating heldout datasets.
}
\usage{
make.heldout(documents, vocab, 
             N=floor(.1*length(documents)), 
             proportion=.5, seed=NULL)
eval.heldout(model, missing)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{documents}{the documents to be modeled.
}
  \item{vocab}{
  the vocabulary item
  }
  \item{N}{
  number of docs to be partially held out
  }
  \item{proportion}{
  proportion of docs to be held out.
  }
  \item{seed}{
  the seed, set for replicability
  }
  \item{model}{
  an stm model
  }
  \item{missing}{
  a missing object created by make.heldout
  }
}
\details{
These functions are used to create and evaluate heldout likelihood using the document completion method.  The basic idea is to hold out some fraction of the words in a set of documents, train the model and use the document-level latent variables to evaluate the probability of the heldout portion. See the example for the basic workflow.
